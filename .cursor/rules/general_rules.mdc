These rules supersede all others. Always follow them unless explicitly overridden by the user.

**1. Refer to API Docs**
Reference [zoho_Api.txt](mdc:docs/active_docs/zoho_Api.txt)or all API call construction and updates.

**2. Maintain project_directory.txt**
Always update docs/active_docs/project_directory.txt ( [project_directory.txt](mdc:docs/active_docs/project_directory.txt) ) when adding/moving files or fo as the source of truth for navigation and import paths.

**3. Keep [data_flow.txt](mdc:docs/active_docs/data_flow.txt) Updated**
Document how API data enters, gets processed, and flows through the UI.
Use this structure:

```md
## API → Processor → Store → Component
- So.creator.api.getMainProjects()`
- Processor: `processMainProjects()`
- Store: `projectsStore.mainProjects`
- Component: `KanbanColumn.vue`ects`)
```

**4. Never Assume, Always Ask**
If uncertain about file contents, flow, or intent, ask the user first before proceeding.

**5. Prefer Composition API**
Use Vue Composition API for all new code. Avoid Option API.

**6. Avoid Browser Alerts**
Use the system-wide notification system for alerts and errors—never `alert()`.
