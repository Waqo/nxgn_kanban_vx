These are the most important rules, they supercede any other document.

**1. Use Raw API Names:** Always use the API name from the raw project data as much as possible. Exceptions are constructed fields and object fields (for example: Tranche and New_Stage in project data).

**2. Consult API Docs:** Refer to [zoho_Api.txt](mdc:docs/active_docs/zoho_Api.txt) when constructing, altering or adjusting new API calls.

**3. Keep Helper Functions Separate:**
   *   General utility/formatting functions (e.g., date formatters, relative time calculators) should reside in `app/utils/helpers.js`, [helpers.js](mdc:app/utils/helpers.js). 
   *   Functions specifically designed to transform the structure of raw Zoho API responses should reside in `app/utils/processors.js`, [processors.js](mdc:app/utils/processors.js).
   *   Import these functions where needed rather than defining them locally within components or store modules.

**4. Maintain Project Directory [project_directory.txt](mdc:docs/active_docs/project_directory.txt) :**
   *   Keep the `docs/active_docs/project_directory.txt` file updated whenever new files are added, moved, or the folder structure is changed.

**5. Use Project Directory for Navigation:**
   *   Refer to `docs/active_docs/project_directory.txt` when unsure about the location of a specific file or the overall project structure. 

**6. Keep The Active Project Build Plan Updated:**
   *   Current Active Build Plan is [current_detail_modal_build_plan.txt](mdc:docs/current_docs/current_detail_modal_build_plan.txt)
   *   When a step is completed, add a note to the ## 7. Development Notes section..
   *   When user instruction changes the order of development, or introduces new step, add a note to the ## 7. Development Notes section.
